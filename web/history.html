    <p>In 1860, the Indigo revolt spread throughout the Bengal province. Shalghar Madhua in Kushtia district was one of
      the forerunners in this movement. It inspired all indigo farmers in Kushtia to refrain from paying government
      taxes.
      Subsequently, with the publication of the Indigo Commission Report, an act was passed prohibiting coercion of
      cultivators for indigo cultivation and the measure led to the end of the movement.</p>

    <p>During the Partition of India in 1947, three sub-divisions of Nadia district i.e. Kushtia, Chuadanga and Meherpur
      were made into a new district of Kushtia in the then East Pakistan. The town once again became attractive for
      development in 1954 with the establishment of the Ganges-Kobadak Irrigation Project (also known as G-K Project)
      headquarters and a number of government offices. The G-K Project is a large surface-irrigation system, with the
      first crop under this project grown in 1962–63.</p>

    <p>The district of Kushtia had significant contribution to the Bangladesh Liberation War. A 147-member company of
      the
      27th Baloch Regiment of the Pakistan Army reached Kushtia on 25 March 1971 from its base at Jessore cantonment.
      They
      initially captured the local police station and settled an outpost there, but soon faced considerable resistance
      from a group of police, ansars, students and local people. By 1 April, the Pakistani army was completely
      overpowered
      and the Mukti Bahini took control of Kushtia and emerged victorious in the Battle. Later on 17 April 1971 the
      Bangladesh Government in-exile formally announced Proclamation of Independence at Baidyanathtala. Subsequently,
      battles between the Pakistan Army and the rebels occurred at many places of the district including Bangshitala of
      Kumarkhali Upazila, and Daulatpur Upazila.</p>

    <p>After the independence of Bangladesh several different development projects were undertaken in the district of
      Kushtia. On 22 November 1979 the foundation stone of The Islamic University was laid at Shantidanga – Dulalpur
      under
      the districts of Kushtia and Jhenidah. However, in 1982 the university was shifted to Gazipur and admission of
      students began in the session of 1985–86. Later, on 10 January 1990, the university shifted back to its original
      site at Shantidanga Dulalpur. In 1984, two subdivisions of Kushtia, Chuadanga and Meherpur, were named separate
      districts.</p>
